## 🚨 The Problem
NIL created new earning opportunities for athletes, but it also introduced:
- **Unclear contracts & broken promises**
- **Payment delays and disputes**
- **Compliance complexity across NCAA + state rules**
- **Poor long-term financial planning**

> A major risk: **many athletes struggle financially after their career**, so NIL income needs **structure + protection**, not just spending.

---

## 💡 The Solution (Athlete Vault)
Athlete Vault puts athletes in control of NIL deals with:
- ✅ **Guaranteed, on-time payments** via blockchain smart contracts  
- ✅ **No agents required** (less friction, more transparency)  
- ✅ **Automated savings & wealth building** using a **Fixed Index Annuity (FIA)**  
- ✅ **AI-powered NIL valuation** to estimate fair market value + detect fraud  
- ✅ **Education, tax automation, and compliance monitoring**

## ⭐ Key Features
### 🔗 Blockchain Smart Contracts
- Automates NIL payments

### 🤖 AI-Powered NIL Valuation + Deal Fairness

### 🎚 Dual-Slider Deal Negotiation (Market Fit Engine)
Athletes and brands each set:

**If ranges overlap:** the system recommends a fair settlement price using market data + fairness principles  
**If ranges don’t overlap:** AI suggests adjustments based on comparable deals

### 💰 Automated Savings & Investments (FIA)
A portion of each NIL payout can automatically be set aside into a **Fixed Index Annuity**:
- Tax-deferred growth
- Market downside protection
- Built for long-term stability
